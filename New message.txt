Merge conflicts in codebases typically arise when multiple developers simultaneously make changes to the same part of a codebase and then attempt to merge those changes. Common reasons include edits to the same lines of code, file deletions while another developer is editing the same file, or simultaneous changes to the project's structure that are incompatible with each other. Unresolved merge conflicts can significantly hinder project development and team collaboration. They lead to delays in project timelines as the team must pause to resolve these conflicts before moving forward. Furthermore, they can cause frustration among team members, potentially leading to a breakdown in communication and a decrease in productivity. In severe cases, unresolved conflicts might result in data loss or introduce bugs if not properly managed, compromising the integrity of the project. Addressing merge conflicts promptly and effectively is crucial to maintaining a smooth development process and ensuring that team efforts are harmonized towards the project's objectives.
From the first lesson, we learned that merge conficts commonly occur when many people are making edits at the same time or deleting files. More specifically, a merge conflict is taking place when two commits contain changes in the same line/file and are from two separate branches. In these cases, Git does not know which version to keep, so it raises the merge conflict. These conflicts can cause a slowdown in project development as they need to be fixed before the team can move forward. Additionally, this could create a strain on the team if work is constantly having to be revisited before continuing. This is why commnication so important when working on such projects: it allows the team make sure that the work is being done in the most efficient manner possible.
